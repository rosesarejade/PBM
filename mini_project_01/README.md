## _STARLIGHT: Las Estrellas_
A simple personal blog mobile view

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a learning to develop Flutter application.

To get started take inspirations from related websites of choice, some of the references used in this project:
- [A recipe blog](https://bromabakery.com/)
- [An art shop](https://kennedywalsh.com/)

Analyze the elements into sections; such as buttons, rows, columns, etc. then wireframe the pages to code as follows
- the first page

![main](1.png)

- the second page

![gallery](2.png)

## The Project
in this documentation running the ```main.dart``` will show the main page:

![Homepage](image-1.png)

and the Gallery view once the saved bookmark button on the top right is clicked:
